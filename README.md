# p5_socket.io
A real-time, collaborative drawing canvas.

Project includes Node.js server using Express.js framework to host a directory. Inside that directory is a p5.js sketch and socket.IO, which enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication.

Created a socket connection between sketch and server to have messages going from one client, to the server, and to another client, etc. A shared sketch can be reflected across multiple browser sessions.
