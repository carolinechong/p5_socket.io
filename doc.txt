Websockets and p5.js

Node server using Express to host a directory. Inside that directory is a p5.js sketch.

Create a socket connection between sketch and server to have messages going from one client to the server to another client. 

Technologies used: p5.js, Node.js, Express.js, socket.IO

Socket.IO enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication.

Two different instances of the same sketch.
When client1 sends, send2 receives (and vice versa).

Server.js
Code for running server: receiving socket msgs and sending back to clients

Sketch.js
Client code, which sends msgs to the server and also receives msgs from the server.

Programmed a shared, collaborative drawing canvas. Broadcasts messages between clients and the server.
